# Testing Node.js with Mocha

![image](mocha-chai-cover.png)

### Testing with Mocha  
  
- Mocha as a test runner
- Dig into the mechanics
- "describes" and "it"s
- The whole life cycle
- Managing what tests execute like "only" or "skip"

### BDD Style Assertions with Chai

- Chai provides two different options of natural assertion:
    - Expect
    - Should
- Verifing objects can be achived with the "deep" attribute.

### Spy, Stubs and Mocks with Sinon

**Sinon.spy** makes sure a function is called by watching it. 

**Sinon.stub** is going to take a function and replace it with a own one.
Replacing objects allows to do real _unit_ testing.

**Sinon.mocks** are fake methods (spy), pre-programmed behavior (stubs) and pre-programmed expectations. So mocks allow to wrap all behavior together.
